# Sandbox
Collaborative pages for KW-GK

This is a place for students of KW to learn the basic capabilities of files on computers to hold and display and pass around information via the internet - the Web.

We will share this Sandbox as a place to experiment and collaborate with each other as a team from far away corners of the states where we live physically.

We will explore the geography of our computers locally - creating and editing files of various types and storing them in a logical geography of folders and file-names and paths. Similarly we will copy those files to computers "out there' in the cloud - in a geography which is the Internet but broken down to files with names or url's in some folders 'out there' which we can 'see' in our browsers.  We will learn we can control these files and what they look like to anyone who wants to look.

Thus we will publish our files to the Internet where they can be read.
